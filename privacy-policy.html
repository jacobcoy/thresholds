        <p class="body"><span>Summary</span><br>We respect the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this policy explains how we collect and treat any information you give us.

        </p>
        
        <p class="body"><span>Our policy covers</span>
        <li class="bodyli">Why we value your privacy</li>
        <li class="bodyli">How we collect information</li>
        <li class="bodyli">What information we hold</li>
        <li class="bodyli">Where we store your information</li>
        <li class="bodyli">What we use your information for</li>

        </p>
        
        <p class="body"><span>Why we value your privacy</span><br>We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.</p>
        
        <p class="body"><span>How we collect information</span><br>Our website makes use of cookies or scripts to track your visit to this website via our analytics platform Google Analytics. Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to us directly.</p>

        <p class="body"><span>What information we hold</span>
        <li class="bodyli">We collect data regarding your visit to the website via analytics</li>
        <li class="bodyli">this contains data on demographics, approximate location, browser usage, language and more as governed by Google Analytics</li></p>

        <p class="body"><span>Where we store your information</span><br>When you contact us by email, we store your your information in our secure email service. If you sign up for a newsletter, we store your email address in Mailchimp, which is the marketing platform we prefer. We chose these systems partly for their commitment to security.
        </p>
        
        <p class="body"><span>What we use your information for</span><br>We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our upcoming film festivals. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we won’t send them to you again. We might also email or phone you about our film festivals, but if you tell us not to, we won’t get in touch again.</p>

        <p class="body"><span>Who has access to information about you?</span><br>When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access. Our management team have access to everything you’ve provided, but individual employees have access to only what they need to do their job.</p>
        
        <p class="body"><span>The steps we take to keep your informaton private</span><br>Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it. We use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice. The computers we use are protected by a passcode or fingerprint access. These computers ask for authentication whenever they’re started or after 5 minutes of inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition.</p>
